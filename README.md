# kitti-stereo-devkit-python
KITTI Optical Flow Evaluation 2015 devkit, but with python.
For more info see [KITTI website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=flow).

Currently this code does not work and has only the code for disparity
evaluation in the left image, but more is to come (perhaps).

# License
No idea. The cpp devkit from KITTI does not have a proper license, so I guess I
should just mention [Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/) here.

# Dependencies
python >= 3.6
numpy
opencv
pandas
scikit-image

# Installation
TBD

# Usage
TBD
